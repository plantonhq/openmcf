# KubernetesClickHouse Terraform Module

Deploys one operator-managed ClickHouse cluster: the optional namespace,
the auth Secret (when users are declared), the conditional managed
ClickHouseKeeperInstallation, and the `clickhouse.altinity.com/v1`
ClickHouseInstallation CR. The custom resources apply through
`kubectl_manifest` (alekc/kubectl provider, server-side apply), which
needs no cluster connection at plan time — the cluster can be planned
before the Altinity operator's CRDs exist.

Prerequisites at apply time: the Altinity ClickHouse operator
(`KubernetesAltinityOperator`) watching the deployment namespace.

## Module Behavior

- **One CHI, everything else operator-created** — every shard×replica
  host is its own single-pod StatefulSet + headless Service
  (`chi-<name>-<cluster>-<shard>-<replica>`), the per-cluster Service is
  `cluster-<name>-<cluster>`, and the cluster-wide client Service is
  `clickhouse-<name>` (the `service_name` output; native protocol 9000,
  HTTP 8123). There are NO ingress resources by design — every generated
  Service is ClusterIP; exposure composes from first-class kinds
  referencing the exported handles.
- **Coordination resolves automatically** — with `coordination` unset,
  the module deploys a managed ClickHouse Keeper
  (ClickHouseKeeperInstallation `<name>-keeper`, client Service
  `keeper-<name>-keeper`) whenever the topology needs one (replicas > 1
  or shards > 1) and none otherwise. `managed_keeper` forces it,
  `external_keeper`/`external_zookeeper` render explicit
  `zookeeper.nodes` (plus optional `root`/`identity`), `none` omits the
  section entirely. The managed Keeper is wired through the CHI's native
  keeper reference — the operator resolves the endpoints itself.
- **Passwords never appear in the CHI** — the module writes each user's
  (already-resolved) password into the `<name>-clickhouse-auth` Secret,
  one key per user name, and the CHI's path-keyed users section
  references the keys via `valueFrom.secretKeyRef`. KNOW THIS
  (upstream-documented): secret-sourced passwords reach ClickHouse
  through pod environment variables, so rotating the Secret alone does
  not re-render config — bump any spec field to roll a rotation out.
- **Unset optionals are omitted** — the rendered CR bodies are
  null-pruned so the apiserver applies the CRD's own defaults.
  Presence-sensitive sections render only on divergence:
  `secret.auto: "true"` only when `auto_inter_node_secret` (default
  true) AND the topology has more than one host;
  `storageManagement.reclaimPolicy: Retain` only when
  `retain_volumes_on_delete`; `podDistribution` (ShardAntiAffinity) only
  when `spread_replicas_across_nodes`; `stop: "yes"` only when
  `stopped`. The CRD's StringBool fields render as strings, counts as
  YAML numbers, `access_management` as the number 1.
- **The client serviceTemplate exists only when it has something to
  carry** — `service_annotations` renders serviceTemplate "client" with
  `generateName: clickhouse-{chi}` (pinning the operator's own default
  name, so annotating never renames the Service) and type ClusterIP.
- **Path-keyed passthrough is the upstream's native model** —
  `settings`, `files`, and the flattened `profiles`/`quotas` bundles
  (`<bundle>/<path>` = value) land verbatim in the CHI's own maps.
- **The CHI podTemplate takes ONE image string** — the shared
  ContainerImage folds into `repo:tag`, defaulting to
  `clickhouse/clickhouse-server:<version>` (never the operator's
  implicit `latest`); `image.pull_secret_name` joins
  `image_pull_secrets`, deduplicated.
- **The module (not the operator) owns namespace creation** —
  `create_namespace` drives a `kubernetes_namespace_v1` resource
  carrying the standard governance labels.

## Resources

| Resource | Condition |
|---|---|
| `kubernetes_namespace_v1.namespace` | `spec.create_namespace` |
| `kubernetes_secret_v1.auth` | `spec.users` non-empty |
| `kubectl_manifest.keeper` | coordination resolves to a managed Keeper |
| `kubectl_manifest.clickhouse_installation` | always |

## Usage

```bash
planton tofu apply --manifest kubernetes-click-house.yaml
```

## Local Development

```bash
tofu init -backend=false
tofu validate
tofu plan -var-file=terraform.tfvars.json
tofu apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars.json
```

The full-surface hack manifest for offline proofs lives in `../hack/`.

## Inputs

See `variables.tf` for the full variable specification (generated from
the spec proto). The spec arrives from the proto→tfvars converter in
snake_case with every `StringValueOrRef` foreign key — `namespace`
(KubernetesNamespace), `storage_class` and the managed-Keeper
`coordination.keeper.storage_class` (KubernetesStorageClass), each
user's `password` — resolved to a literal string before Terraform runs.
Enum fields arrive as the proto enum value names (e.g. "managed_keeper",
"external_zookeeper").

## State Import

Existing deployments can be adopted into state. `kubectl_manifest` uses
the composed import ID `apiVersion//kind//name//namespace`; every name
is deterministic (the CHI is `metadata.name`, the Keeper
`<name>-keeper`, the auth Secret `<name>-clickhouse-auth`), so the whole
family imports blind.

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `namespace` | Namespace the cluster runs in |
| `chi_name` | Name of the ClickHouseInstallation resource (equals `metadata.name`) |
| `cluster_name` | Logical ClickHouse cluster name (the `ON CLUSTER` / remote_servers target) |
| `service_name` | The cluster-wide client Service (`clickhouse-<name>`) |
| `tcp_endpoint` | In-cluster native-protocol endpoint (`<svc>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:9000`) |
| `http_endpoint` | In-cluster HTTP interface endpoint (`http://<svc>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:8123`) |
| `auth_secret_name` | `<name>-clickhouse-auth` — empty when no users are declared |
| `keeper_name` | `<name>-keeper` — empty when coordination is external or none |
| `keeper_service_name` | `keeper-<keeper_name>` — empty when coordination is external or none |
| `port_forward_command` | Port-forward command for workstation access |

## Parity

This module is the behavioral twin of the Pulumi module
(`../pulumi/module/`): same rendered CR bodies (null-pruned,
presence-sensitive sections on divergence, StringBool strings), same
coordination auto-resolution, same module-owned constants (image
defaulting, template names "server"/"data"/"logs"/"client", Keeper
cluster name "keeper"), same outputs — keep them in lockstep.
