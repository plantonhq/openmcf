# Production replicated preset

The durability posture: one shard carried by three replicas in
ReplicatedMergeTree lockstep, coordinated by a three-node managed
Keeper (survives one Keeper loss), with replicas forced onto
different Kubernetes nodes and volumes that outlive the resource.
Losing any single node — ClickHouse or Keeper — loses nothing.

Two decisions here deserve conscious ownership. First,
`retain_volumes_on_delete: true` means deleting the resource keeps
every PVC; that is the safety you want in production, and it also
means cleanup is a deliberate manual act — nothing garbage-collects
retained data. Second, the user split: `analyst` runs under a
readonly profile with a quota, `ingest` holds narrow SQL grants.
Passwords land in a Kubernetes Secret, never in the custom resource —
still, replace the placeholders before this manifest reaches any
real environment.

The first thing to change is capacity: `disk_size` (it can grow
later but never shrink) and the memory pair — ClickHouse earns its
speed with memory, and the `max_memory_usage` profile setting should
track the container limit. Scale `shards` only when one shard can no
longer carry the dataset; replicas buy durability, shards buy
capacity.

See [02-production-replicated.yaml](./02-production-replicated.yaml)
for the manifest.
