# conditional entries are written as `key = cond ? value : null` inside ONE
# object literal, pruned with `{ for k, v in {...} : k => v if v != null }`.
# The two tempting alternatives are both broken: `cond ? {...} : {}`
# ternaries fail plan-time type unification when branches carry different
# attributes, and merge() over conditional lists silently UNIFIES
# primitive-only sibling objects into map(string). The null-prune form
# preserves every value's type.
#
# Optional nested blocks are read with try(): HCL's && does NOT
# short-circuit, so chained null checks still dereference the null.
