# internal/resources

Resource builders, Helm chart rendering, credential generation, and embedded manifests for Kubernetes objects managed by the operator.

## Responsibility

This package generates Kubernetes resource objects for the operator to apply. It owns five concerns:

1. **Helm chart values builders**: Functions that construct Helm values maps for each data layer and supporting service component, rendered at runtime via the Helm SDK.
2. **Embedded chart archives**: `.tgz` Helm chart files embedded in the binary via `//go:embed`, rendered at runtime for air-gap compatibility.
3. **Embedded operator manifests**: Vendored upstream release YAML for sub-operators (CloudNativePG, Tekton Pipelines), applied via Server-Side Apply.
4. **Credential generation**: Secure password generation and Secret construction for operator-managed authentication.
5. **Connection abstraction**: Helpers resolving each data service's connection details behind one seam per service.

## Deployment Pattern (DD-13)

All data layer and supporting service components are deployed via Helm charts rendered at runtime using `RenderHelmChart()`. This is the single rendering pipeline for the entire operator:

```
Embedded .tgz → RenderHelmChart(chartData, releaseName, namespace, values) → []*unstructured.Unstructured → Server-Side Apply
```

## Object Type Strategy

- **Helm chart rendering** for chart-shipped components: Valkey (the redis-protocol cache), OpenFGA, Temporal, OpenBAO, Neo4j.
- **Unstructured** for third-party CRs the operator declares against sub-operators: the CloudNativePG `postgresql.cnpg.io/v1` Cluster.
- **Typed Go objects** for operator-generated credential Secrets and bootstrap ConfigMaps.

## Helm Charts Embedded

| Component | Chart | Version | Mode |
|-----------|-------|---------|------|
| Valkey (redis-protocol cache) | bitnamicharts/valkey | 3.0.31 | Always (no mode field) |
| OpenFGA | openfga/openfga | 0.2.12 | Always |
| Temporal | temporal/temporal | 0.62.0 | Always |

## Credential Generation

`GeneratePassword()` produces 32-character URL-safe base64 passwords via `crypto/rand`. `NewCredentialSecret()` wraps them in a K8s Secret with owner references for cascading deletion. Each Helm chart references credentials via `existingSecret` values. The DataLayer phase uses get-or-create semantics: passwords are generated once and never regenerated.

PostgreSQL is the exception by design: CloudNativePG generates and owns the superuser credential Secret (`{cluster}-superuser`), so the credential lives and dies with the volumes it unlocks.

## PostgreSQL (CloudNativePG)

The platform's database is one `postgresql.cnpg.io/v1` Cluster per install, built by `NewPostgreSQLCluster` and reconciled by the CloudNativePG operator (vendored release, installed as a prerequisite via the detect-or-install gate). `spec.database.postgresql.replicas` turns the same cluster into a streaming-replication HA topology with automated failover.

`PostgreSQLConnection()` returns host, port, and credential references for the platform cluster: every consumer (control plane, identity server, OpenFGA, Temporal) connects through the cluster's read-write Service as the superuser -- the single-user, self-provisioned-databases contract shared with the desktop daemon's local instance.

## Service Host Helpers

Each component exports a `*ServiceHost(crName, namespace)` function returning the in-cluster FQDN. These are used by later phases to wire connection strings into application environment variables.
