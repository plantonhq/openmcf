# Dev minimal preset

The smallest declarable ClickHouse that actually serves: one host, a
PVC, a pinned server version and one named user. No Keeper is
deployed because a single-replica topology needs no coordination —
which also means no replication: every pod restart is a brief outage
and losing the volume loses the data. That trade-off is the point of
this preset; it exists for developers and CI who need the real
ClickHouse SQL surface without production ceremony.

Be clear-eyed about access: the operator keeps the built-in `default`
user passwordless but network-restricted to the cluster's own pods,
so the declared user (whose password lands in a Kubernetes Secret,
never in the custom resource) is the only real doorway. Change that
password before the manifest leaves your laptop.

The first thing to change is `version` — pin the line your clients
test against — and `disk_size`, which cannot shrink later. When the
data starts mattering, graduate to the production preset's replicated
topology instead of just raising numbers here.

See [01-dev-minimal.yaml](./01-dev-minimal.yaml) for the manifest.
