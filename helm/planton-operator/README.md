# Planton Operator Helm Chart

Deploy the [Planton Operator](https://github.com/plantonhq/planton) to any Kubernetes cluster.

The Planton Operator watches for `PlantonPlatform` custom resources and deploys the full
Planton platform stack: PostgreSQL, Valkey, OpenFGA, Temporal, the control plane
monolith, and the web console. A single YAML file is all it takes to go from an empty cluster
to a running Planton instance.

This chart installs the operator and the definitions it serves (`PlantonPlatform`,
`PlantonIdentityProvider`), and owns their lifecycle: upgrading the chart upgrades the
schema with the operator that reads it. The platform itself is a `PlantonPlatform`
resource you create afterwards -- by hand, through GitOps, or as its own Helm release
with the [`planton` chart](../planton), which carries proven defaults and per-cloud
values files. Run exactly one Planton operator per cluster: a second installation
refuses to start and its log explains why.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.24+
- Helm 3.x

## Installation

The chart is published to GitHub Container Registry as an OCI artifact:

```bash
helm install planton-operator oci://ghcr.io/plantonhq/charts/planton-operator \
  --namespace planton \
  --create-namespace
```

Pin a specific chart version with `--version <x.y.z>`. The chart and the operator share
one version line: chart `x.y.z` deploys operator image `vx.y.z`, both published from the
same release tag (override the image with `--set image.tag=<tag>`). A checkout of this
directory is a development build whose version and image tag are placeholders; install
it with `--set image.tag=<published tag>` or an image you built yourself.

After the operator is running, create a `PlantonPlatform` resource to deploy the platform:

```yaml
apiVersion: planton.ai/v1
kind: PlantonPlatform
metadata:
  name: planton
  namespace: planton
spec:
  version: v0.0.44
```

`spec.version` names a Planton platform release as `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`; the API server
refuses any other shape. The operator runs releases from a floor upward: a version older
than the oldest it supports is refused before anything is created, with the reason in the
resource's `MESSAGE` column and a `VersionSupported` condition, and a platform already
running is left untouched. The operator's first log line (`Platform version floor`) names
the floor. To run a custom build, keep `spec.version` at a release and set `image.tag` on
the component: the version names the contract, the tag names the bytes.

Apply it with `kubectl apply -f` and watch progress:

```bash
kubectl get plantonplatform -n planton -w
```

Or declare it as a Helm release with proven defaults:

```bash
helm install planton oci://ghcr.io/plantonhq/charts/planton --namespace planton
```

### Publishing Planton at a URL

External access is a friction ladder in `spec.ingress` -- each rung is one field
up from the last, and every rung is a working deployment:

```yaml
spec:
  ingress:
    enabled: true                # rung 1: URL auto-derived from the ingress
                                 #   controller's address (magic DNS), plain HTTP
    hostname: planton.corp.com   # rung 2: your hostname, plain HTTP
    ingressClassName: nginx      # optional; omit to use the cluster default
    tls:                         # rung 3/4: HTTPS
      secretName: planton-tls    #   EITHER a kubernetes.io/tls Secret you bring
      # issuer:                  #   OR a cert-manager issuer
      #   name: lets-encrypt
      #   kind: ClusterIssuer
```

One hostname serves the web console and the API the browser calls. The platform
reports its URL in `status.consoleUrl` (the `URL` column of
`kubectl get plantonplatform`), and the ingress component's status explains any
misconfiguration in plain language (missing class, missing TLS secret,
cert-manager not installed).

## Architecture

The operator runs as a single Deployment and watches for `PlantonPlatform` resources
in any namespace. When a resource is created, the operator:

1. Deploys the data layer (PostgreSQL via CloudNativePG, Valkey)
2. Deploys supporting services (OpenFGA with authorization model, Temporal with schema)
3. Deploys the application layer (control plane monolith, web console)

Each component is reconciled independently with explicit dependency tracking.
The operator reports per-component status, an aggregate `Ready` condition whose
message is the `MESSAGE` column, and a `VersionSupported` condition:

```
$ kubectl get plantonplatform
NAME      PHASE   VERSION   URL                          LICENSE     MESSAGE                              AGE
planton   Ready   v0.0.44   https://planton.example.com  Community   All enabled components are healthy   5m
```

## CRD Management

The operator's definitions (`PlantonPlatform` and `PlantonIdentityProvider`) are
resources of this release, rendered from `templates/crds/`:

- `helm install` creates them and `helm upgrade` upgrades them, so the schema the
  cluster enforces is always the one the installed operator was built against. A
  `helm rollback` rolls the definitions back with the operator, the same way.
- `helm uninstall` keeps them (`crds.keep`, default `true`) because deleting a
  definition deletes every resource of that kind -- every platform on the cluster.
  Set `crds.keep=false` only when that is what you want.
- `crds.enabled=false` renders none of them, for the one case where another
  release on the cluster already owns them (one operator per cluster).

**Source of truth:** the files in `templates/crds/` and the manager's permissions in
`rbac/manager-role.yaml` are controller-gen output, written by
`make -C operator manifests` in this repository from the operator's Go types and RBAC
markers (the CRD templates add only the `crds.enabled` guard and the keep annotation).
CI regenerates and diffs them on every change, so they are never edited by hand: change
the Go source, regenerate, and the chart follows in the same commit.

### Coming from a chart that installed the definitions once

Chart releases before 0.8.0 shipped the `PlantonPlatform` definition through Helm's
install-once `crds/` directory, which leaves it outside any release. Upgrading such an
install stops with a message from this chart that names the definition and repeats the
two commands below with your release name and namespace filled in. Run them, then
`helm upgrade` again; the release adopts the definition and upgrades its schema:

```bash
kubectl label crd plantonplatforms.planton.ai app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm
kubectl annotate crd plantonplatforms.planton.ai \
  meta.helm.sh/release-name=<release> meta.helm.sh/release-namespace=<namespace>
```

## Uninstallation

```bash
# Remove the operator. The definitions and every PlantonPlatform stay (crds.keep).
helm uninstall planton-operator -n planton

# Reinstalling with the same release name and namespace adopts them again.

# To remove the definitions too -- this destroys every PlantonPlatform on the
# cluster and the platforms they describe -- delete them after the release:
kubectl delete crd plantonplatforms.planton.ai plantonidentityproviders.planton.ai
```
